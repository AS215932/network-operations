# Deploy runbook (CI lane)

How to ship a change from "PR merged" to "live on production." Production is
the next environment after `main` — there is no staging VM, by design (the
approved plan trades fidelity for a smaller blast surface). For app-backed
services, production deploys are promoted through `network-operations` by
pinning exact app commit SHAs. Safety lives in three layers:

1. **App CI** before promotion — the exact app commit has passed its required
   lint, type, and test checks.
2. **Render-check** before merge — the diff between `ansible/generated/` and
   what render produces is empty.
3. **Icinga snapshot bracket** around apply — what was broken before and what
   is broken after, captured as artifacts on the workflow run.

## App promotion model

`hyrule-noc-agent`, `hyrule-mcp`, `hyrule-cloud`, and `hyrule-web` do not own
normal production applies. Their repositories produce reviewed commits with
green CI. `network-operations` owns production by pinning those commits in
inventory:

- `ansible/inventory/host_vars/noc.yml`: `noc_agent_version`,
  `hyrule_mcp_version`
- `ansible/inventory/host_vars/api.yml`: `hyrule_cloud_version`
- `ansible/inventory/host_vars/web.yml`: `hyrule_web_version`

Use the promotion PR template for coordinated deploys. Merge app PRs first,
update the promotion PR to the exact merged app SHAs, run a dry-run from the
promotion branch, then merge and apply from `network-operations/main`.

The normal automated path is:

1. Merge app PRs after app CI is green.
2. Run **Actions -> promote-apps** in this repository and paste the merged app
   SHAs into the relevant inputs.
3. Review the generated promotion PR. It updates the app pins and records
   compare links plus rollback SHAs.
4. Merge the promotion PR after checks pass.
5. **app-promotion-deploy** starts automatically on the `main` push when an app
   pin file changed. It calls `apply.yml` for the affected playbook(s).
6. Approve the GitHub `production` environment gate. This is the intended
   manual deploy step.
7. Review the workflow summary: app pins, compare links, and Icinga snapshot
   diff.

`apply.yml` itself is not a push-triggered workflow. It runs when either:

- an operator manually starts it with `workflow_dispatch`, or
- another workflow calls it through `workflow_call` (for app promotions, this is
  `app-promotion-deploy` after a SHA-pin PR merges).

## When to ship

For pure infrastructure changes, ship after the `network-operations` PR merges
to `main`. For app-backed services, ship only after the app PRs are merged and
the `network-operations` promotion PR pins their exact SHAs. Deploys happen one
at a time. If two operators merge back-to-back, ship sequentially (each apply's
post-snapshot is the next apply's pre-snapshot baseline).

Do not ship during the documented merge-freeze windows (see `MEMORY.md` for
any active freezes).

## How to dispatch a deploy

```bash
gh workflow run apply.yml \
  -F playbook=noc \
  -F limit=noc \
  -F dry_run=false \
  -F pr_number=42         # optional — auto-comments the diff onto the PR
```

Or via the GitHub UI: **Actions → apply → Run workflow → pick playbook /
limit / dry-run / PR**.

The workflow pauses immediately at the **`production` environment review**
gate. Approve in the UI; the run unfreezes.

## What the workflow does

1. **Source secrets** — Vault Agent on the `ci` runner has rendered
   `/etc/github-runner/secrets.env` with `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`,
   `ICINGA_API_USER`, etc. The workflow exports them into `GITHUB_ENV`.
2. **Pre-snapshot** — `ansible-playbook <pb>.yml --tags snapshot -e snapshot_phase=pre`.
   Captures current Icinga problem set from `mon`.
3. **Render-only OR apply** — depending on `dry_run`. Apply uses
   `--tags apply -e <pb>_apply=true --limit <limit>`.
4. **Post-snapshot** — same as step 2 with `snapshot_phase=post`.
5. **Diff snapshots** — `diff -ruN pre post`. The diff lands in the workflow
   run summary, on the named PR (if `pr_number`), and as an uploaded artifact
   (`snapshots-<playbook>-<limit>`).

## How to read the snapshot diff

- **Empty diff** — clean apply. Ship the next change.
- **Lines starting with `+`** — checks that *became* problems. Investigate
  whether your change caused them.
- **Lines starting with `-`** — checks that resolved. Probably unrelated
  (recovery during the apply window); note in run summary.
- **Both `+` and `-` on the same check** — flap. Look at the snapshot's
  detail JSON for last_hard_state_change.

If the diff has `+` entries for checks that look related to your change, the
expected response is:

1. **If the apply succeeded but new checks fail**: roll forward — fix the
   templates and dispatch another apply. Don't roll back the systemd unit
   reload; that just makes the next deploy harder.
2. **If the apply failed mid-flight**: roll back the change with another PR,
   re-dispatch.

## App rollback

Prefer rollback by PR: revert the app version pin in `network-operations` to
the previous known-good SHA, merge the rollback promotion PR, then run
`apply.yml` for the affected playbook.

During an active outage, an operator may pass an explicit old SHA through
Ansible extra-vars from a trusted shell, then follow up with a PR that records
the deployed pin. Extra-vars are an emergency escape hatch, not the normal
promotion path.

## Manual deploy (bypass CI)

When the runner is offline or unreachable. Same shape as the workflow but
local:

```bash
cd ansible
set -a; source ../secrets.local.sh; set +a

# Pre-snapshot (manual)
ansible-playbook playbooks/<pb>.yml --tags snapshot -e snapshot_phase=pre

# Apply
ansible-playbook playbooks/<pb>.yml --tags apply \
  -e '{"<pb>_apply":true}' \
  --limit <limit>

# Post-snapshot
ansible-playbook playbooks/<pb>.yml --tags snapshot -e snapshot_phase=post

# Diff manually
ls -1dt ansible/generated/snapshots/*/ | head -2 | \
  xargs -I{} diff -ruN
```

Record the deploy in the PR description after the fact.

## Environment protection setup (one-time)

The `production` environment with a required reviewer is set via the GitHub
UI: **Settings → Environments → New environment → production → Required
reviewers: @<your-handle>**. Or via:

```bash
gh api -X PUT /repos/AS215932/network-operations/environments/production \
  -f reviewers='[{"type":"User","id":<user-id>}]'
```

Once set, every `apply.yml` run pauses for approval before the apply step.

## Branch protection setup (one-time)

`main` must require: `lint`, `render-check`, `ai-review` checks. See the
PR #44 description (`feat/0d-ci-auto-merge`) for the exact `gh api` call.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Workflow stuck "Waiting for self-hosted runner" | `ci` VM offline / runner not registered | Re-run `docs/ci/provision.md` from step 4 |
| Pre-snapshot fails with "icinga-snapshot not found" | First time apply on a brand-new mon | One-time: SSH to mon and create `/usr/local/bin/icinga-snapshot` (covered separately) |
| Apply step fails with "Permission denied (publickey)" | `runner` user's SSH key not in target host's authorized_keys | Push key via `playbooks/noc-mcp-key.yml`-style fan-out (filed as follow-up if not done) |
| `--limit X` skips snapshot plays | You're running pre-fix #16 code | Confirm the snapshot --limit fix (issue #16) is merged |
